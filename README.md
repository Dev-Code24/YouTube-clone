# YouTube Clone

This is the YouTube clone I am building.
I am building this clone to practice MERN. I am making sure that the UI of this app is identical to the real one.

The UI of this clone is built using React, react-redux, MaterialUI, and Redux-toolkit-query.

The backend of the project is made using NodeJS, and Express. The database for all the models used in this app is MongoDB and all the media is stored in Cloudinary.

[ Update: The UI of this clone is now outdated because while building ( as of Oct 23 ) the UI YouTube updated its UI on Nov 23 ]
